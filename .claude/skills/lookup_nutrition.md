# Look Up Nutritional Information

Find accurate nutritional data for foods.

## Priority of Sources

1. **User-provided info** - If they give you a nutrition label or specific values, use those
2. **USDA FoodData Central** - Most reliable for whole foods. Search at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/
3. **Brand websites** - For packaged/branded foods
4. **Established nutrition databases** - Nutritionix, CalorieKing, etc.

## Process

1. Identify the food item and quantity
2. Clarify if needed:
   - Portion size (small/medium/large, or grams)
   - Preparation method (raw, cooked, fried, etc.)
   - Brand (for packaged foods)
3. Look up values from a reliable source
4. Return the nutritional breakdown

## What to Return

At minimum, always try to get:
- Calories
- Protein (g)
- Carbohydrates (g)
- Fat (g)

If available, also get:
- Fiber, sugar (carb breakdown)
- Saturated fat, trans fat (fat breakdown)
- Sodium, potassium
- Key vitamins and minerals

## Handling Uncertainty

- If the food is ambiguous, ask: "Do you mean X or Y?"
- If portion is unclear, ask or assume standard serving and note it
- If nutritional data varies significantly between sources, mention the range
- For home-cooked meals, break down into ingredients
